                    fried, or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while
                    retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.</p>

                    noodles, and Italian pasta) made into a variety of shapes. While long, thin strips may be the most
                    common, many varieties of noodles are cut into waves, helices, tubes, strings, or shells, or folded
                    over, or cut into other shapes.</p>

                <p class="para">A pancake is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter
                    that
                    may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan,
                    often
                    frying with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread. Archaeological evidence suggests that
